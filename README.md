# Node Farm Server Project

School project for making a server that uses WebSocket to stream sensory data. The scenario is a farm sensors tracking the farm's humidity, temperature, etc.

This data is streamed and can be retrieved by the (front end client)[https://github.com/friskkle/node-farmclient].
To use the server, clone this repository, run `npm install`, and start the server by running `node .` in the terminal of the root of the server folder.
